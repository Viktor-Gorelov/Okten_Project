# Project Details
**Authentication**

The project supports two roles:
- **Admin**
- **Manager**

Use the default admin credentials to log in:
- **Email**: `admin@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `admin`

After logging in, you'll be redirected to the Orders page. 

The following fields are displayed for each application:

- `id`,`name`, `surname`, `email`, `phone`, `age`, `course`, `course_format`, `course_type`,`status`, `sum`, `alreadyPaid`, `created_at`

**Pagination**
- Applications are paginated, showing 25 applications per page.
- By default, applications are sorted in descending order by `created_at`.

The pagination panel operates as follows:

- When you are on the first page: **First Page**
- When you are on a page in the first half of all pages, excluding the first: **First Half**
- When you are on a **Middle** of all page: Both "Previous" and "Next" buttons are visible.
- When you are on a page in the second half of all pages, excluding the last: **Second Half**
- When you are on the last page: **Last Page**

**Sorting**
- Click on any column header to sort applications by that column in **ascending** or **descending** order.
- The sorting preferences are reflected in the Query Parameters.

Additional column are added:
- **manager**: Indicates the manager assigned to order;
- **group**: Indicates the group assigned to order;

Clicking on an application expands its details:
- The **Message** and **UTM** fields display information from the database table.
- Input field allows you to enter comments to order.
- Comments can only be added to applications without an assigned manager or manager is current user.
- Submitting a comment, the current user's name is recorded in the "manager" column, and the status is set to **In Work** if it was previously null or **New**.
- The comment, author, and date displayed.

**Modal Window EDIT**

Clicking the **EDIT** open a modal window with an edit form:
- Only applications without an assigned manager or current user is owner can be edited.
- All form fields can be left empty.
- The form include functionality to add a new group directly from the modal window.
- Performed validation.

**Filtration**

Added inputs and selects for filters of orders:
- `Name`, `Surname`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Age`, `Start date`, `End date` - inputs for writing;
- `Courses`, `Course Formats`, `Course Types`, `Statuses`, `Groups` - selects for selection;
- Filtering by text fields can search for matches across the entire field;
- There is a checkbox that filters only your applications and a button that clears all filters;
- Button that will form an Excel table (file) of applications according to your filters;

**Header**
- Has a logo, current username, button logout and admin button if you admin;

**Admin Panel**
- Page have statistics of all orders which contains: `Total`, `Agree`, `In Work`, `Disagree`, `Dubbing`, `New`.  

**Modal Window CREATE**

Clicking the **CREATE** open a modal window create manager:
- For creating manager need enter Email, Name and Surname;
- After clicking **CREATE** in modal window created manager should be displayed in the list of managers.

**List of Managers**
- To activate the manager, you need to click on the **ACTIVATE** button, at the same time a link with a token should be generated (token lifetime 30 minutes) for activation and copied to the clipboard;
- Example: http://bigbird.space/activate/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWN0aXZhdGUiLCJleHAiOjE2OTA5OTAzMTEsImlhdCI6MTY5MDk4OTcxMSwianRpIjoiNzExZTljMjE0YjIxNGY5NDgyOTQwNzg0ZTM3ZjNjZDIiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMDl9.1tJKW5zZjSbHsTP0zI8QOfSxCtZâ€”Pxta9j7YjsziDE
- This link is sent to the manager in any way and when you click on it, you should get to the page for creating a password, after that, the manager can log in and deal with requests.

There are three buttons for each user:
- **ACTIVATE** if it is not yet activated;
- **RECOVERY PASSWORD** to recover the password (the flow is the same as during activation);
- **BAN** to block the user (blocked users cannot log in);
- **UNBAN** to unblock the user; 

Each manager must have individual statistics on his requests as well as orders;

**Pagination**
- List of managers are paginated, showing 6 managers per page;
- By default, managers are sorted in descending order by `created_at`.
